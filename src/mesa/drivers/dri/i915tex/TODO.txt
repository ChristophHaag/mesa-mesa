6) manytex -n 1000 crash
   ---> intel_frame_flush_and_restart is pretty bogus.


15) cache_mode_0
		+(1<<9) ??

17) Software cull triangles

19) pageflip lockups

21) zEvict if initial clear wasn't a clear rect

22) Don't ZONE_INIT halfway through a frame

23) window resizes / moves
	   --> abandon frame
	   --> disable SWZ, translate away zone_init, fixup draw_rects??

24) SWZ cliprects
	   --> ???  back copy from frontbuffer ???
	   --> then disable swz/hwz

25) quake3
	- clears don't seem to work right.

30) need to update clearparams on clear depth change.


34) MI_FLUSH'es for clearparam state and some other STATIC state.

35) Turn off stipple for clear rect clears.

36) FBO apps are broken, eg tests/fbo*, demos/shadowtex

37) gearbox clears are broken

38) demos/streaming_rect is broken

39) demos/glutfx  >1024 zones

======================================================================
Postpone:

16) swz LOCAL_VERTS


3) line stipple reset

4) lineloops begin/end

5) unfilled polygon begin/end


3) Handling HWB out of memory conditions

4) Synchronization of BPL and bin batchbuffer access between HWB and
   PRB.
    --> Michel


xx) Clean up HWZ DRM interface
	- Remove anything related to high-priority PRB.
	- Don't pass drawrect info members to render sub-ioctl explicitly.
	- ...

xx) Move HWZ DRM code to its own file.




debug
	- buffer capture
	- buffer replay - can this work???
		 - force ttm upload at specific address???
