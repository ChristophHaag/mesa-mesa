6) manytex -n 1000 crash
   ---> intel_frame_flush_and_restart is pretty bogus.


15) cache_mode_0
		+(1<<9) ??
   ---> Probably only useful with tiled textures?

19) pageflip lockups
   ---> Still reproducible?

21) zEvict if initial clear wasn't a clear rect

34) MI_FLUSH'es for clearparam state and some other STATIC state.

35) Turn off stipple for clear rect clears.

38) demos/streaming_rect is broken

39) demos/glutfx  >1024 zones


======================================================================
Postpone:

16) swz LOCAL_VERTS


3) line stipple reset

4) lineloops begin/end

5) unfilled polygon begin/end


3) Handling HWB out of memory conditions

4) Synchronization of BPL and bin batchbuffer access between HWB and
   PRB.

xx) Clean up HWZ DRM interface
	- Remove anything related to high-priority PRB.
	- Don't pass BPL number to render sub-ioctl but just do round robin
	  internally.
	- ...

xx) Move HWZ DRM code to its own file.
