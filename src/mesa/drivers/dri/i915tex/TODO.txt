0) swrast synchronization

1) Make HWZ usable by multiple contexts concurrently.
    --> Michel

2) clipping vertices - seem to start at 0x100??
    - see tri-dlist

3) Handling HWB out of memory conditions

4) Synchronization of BPL and bin batchbuffer access between HWB and
   PRB.

6) manytex -n 1000 lockup


15) cache_mode_0
		+(1<<9) ??

17) Software cull triangles

19) pageflip lockups

21) zEvict if initial clear wasn't a clear rect

22) Don't ZONE_INIT halfway through a frame

23) window resizes / moves
	   --> abandon frame
	   --> disable SWZ, translate away zone_init, fixup draw_rects??

24) cliprects
	- Relatively straightforward with HWZ: Pass cliprects to HWZ
	  alloc sub-ioctl and in the render sub-ioctl fire each bin
	  batchbuffer for each cliprect it intersects. This requires
	  moving the drawing rectangle setup out of the beginning of the
	  bin batchbuffers into the PRB stream.
	   --> ???  back copy from frontbuffer ???
	   --> then disable swz/hwz

25) quake3
	- swz - wierd corruptions on background areas.
	- clears don't seem to work right.

26) demos/reflect
	- swz doesn't render the reflected objects.
	- clearparam issue???

28) swz demos/engine is wierd...

30) need to update clearparams on clear depth change.

xx) Clean up HWZ DRM interface
	- Remove anything related to high-priority PRB.
	- Don't pass drawrect info members to render sub-ioctl explicitly.
	- ...

xx) Move HWZ DRM code to its own file.

======================================================================
Postpone:

16) swz LOCAL_VERTS


3) line stipple reset

4) lineloops begin/end

5) unfilled polygon begin/end

7) polystipple not working

8) poly offset?


debug
	- buffer capture
	- buffer replay - can this work???
		 - force ttm upload at specific address???
