======================================================================
Postpone:

16) swz LOCAL_VERTS


3) line stipple reset

4) lineloops begin/end

5) unfilled polygon begin/end


3) Handling HWB out of memory conditions

4) Synchronization of BPL and bin batchbuffer access between HWB and
   PRB.

	- ...
