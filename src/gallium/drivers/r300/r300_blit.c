     *
     * If fastfill is enabled, a few facts should be considered:
     *
     * 1) Zbuffer must be micro-tiled and whole microtiles must be
     *    written.
     *
     * 2) ZB_DEPTHCLEARVALUE is used to clear a zbuffer and Z Mask must be
     *    equal to 0.
     *
     * 3) RB3D_COLOR_CLEAR_VALUE is used to clear a colorbuffer and
     *    RB3D_COLOR_CHANNEL_MASK must be equal to 0.
     *
     * 4) ZB_CB_CLEAR can be used to make the ZB units help in clearing
     *    the colorbuffer. The color clear value is supplied through both
     *    RB3D_COLOR_CLEAR_VALUE and ZB_DEPTHCLEARVALUE, and the colorbuffer
     *    must be set in ZB_DEPTHOFFSET and ZB_DEPTHPITCH in addition to
     *    RB3D_COLOROFFSET and RB3D_COLORPITCH. It's obvious that the zbuffer
     *    will not be cleared and multiple render targets cannot be cleared
     *    this way either.
     *
     * 5) For 16-bit integer buffering, compression causes a hung with one or
     *    two samples and should not be used.
     *
     * 6) Fastfill must not be used if reading of compressed Z data is disabled
     *    and writing of compressed Z data is enabled (RD/WR_COMP_ENABLE),
     *    i.e. it cannot be used to compress the zbuffer.
     *    (what the hell does that mean and how does it fit in clearing
     *    the buffers?)
